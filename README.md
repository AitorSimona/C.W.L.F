# Traverser
### *By Aitor Simona*

Video game characters interact with the objects in the world in many different ways. They climb, vault and hold onto objects. They slide on ice, and dive into water. The idea behind this work is to provide a modular and easy to use framework that simplifies the process of creating all of these different interactions.

## CWLF Project

Stands for character world linking framework (old name, renamed to Traverser). It made use of Unity's new animation system Kinematica, but due to different reasons including it being stopped for the whole 2021 in a non production-ready state and lack of hackability, I decided to get by without it, giving place to the new Traverser project.
