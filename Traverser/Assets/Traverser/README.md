# Traverser
### *By Aitor Simona*

Video game characters interact with the objects in the world in many different ways. 
They climb, vault and hold onto objects. They slide on ice, and dive into water. 
The idea behind this work is to provide a modular and easy to use framework that simplifies the process 
of creating all of these different interactions.
