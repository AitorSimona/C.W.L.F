Traverser is a player traversal toolkit featuring as of now the most basic traversal abilities which are 
Locomotion, Parkour and Climbing. It is self-contained in a set of scripts and has no dependencies apart 
from the basic Unity functionality. Use the given abilities or expand the system through its shared 
ability workflow.
